This is the kernel Source code for the ZTE V970 / V970M / Smart a18 (MEDIATEK MT6577)
Linux 3.4.5


Building the Kernel:
********************
cd to kernel dir
********************

- Run script "./build.sh ztev970" to begin with the build process.
  Once finished, you will find the new zImage file in the kernel root folder (./kernelFile).

- Rename the "kernelFile" to "zImage" and repack with stock RamDisk


- To perform a clean build run command "./build.sh clean ztev970".
